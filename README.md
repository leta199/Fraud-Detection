# Fraud Detection Project

A classic problem in financial environments. We will take a look at classifying transactions into fraud and not fraud using scikit-learn packages.  
The dataset is obtained from Kaggle here: [Digital Payment Fraud Detecton](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jayjoshi37/digital-payment-fraud-detection/data)
This project will go over using scikit-learn in binary classification  for this dataset and we will cover:   

1. Data Exploration 
2. Data prepartion and pre-processing 
3. Modelling 
4. Evaluation and testing
